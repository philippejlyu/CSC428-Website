        <h3><li>What is the location of the reflections' algorithm, and how do I update my overall reflection progress?</li></h3>
        The algorithm to follow for the reflections can be found <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/11Z9RFJCrTzhDhzxSKWYpafpG_PKJJRGimARdkZNz3wk/edit">here</a>, and the tracker for the class reflections (as well as the assignments) can be found on <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1sF6aGzi3EXq949S1n5_JPu_EN1pgyPOr6O_9Xk3k0jI/edit#gid=1546284607">this</a> link.
        <br><br> 
        <h3><li>Where can I find previous lecture recordings?</li></h3>
        All lecture recordings are posted on the class <a href="https://discord.com/channels/1061342191861112852/1061440343276519475">Discord channel</a>.
        <br><br>
        <h3><li>Where can I find the contribution document?</li></h3>
        The contribution document can be found <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1RWHXyg9gSa6vtYMFfTvU94EI53brEoV2tvS_sTJYA80/edit#">here</a>. You will need to update this monthly (or all at once) for all of your class contributions.
        <br><br>
        <h3><li>Is there a strict deadline for A1, A2?</li></h3>
        While it initially caused some confusion among students, the teaching team has further clarified that the final deadlines for the assignments need to be before the deadlines posted on the <a href="http://tiny.cc/hclist">tracker</a> sheet (April 14 for A2). 
        <br><br>   
        <h3><li>What are the final deadlines for all the final deliverables in the class?</li></h3>
        The second <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1To2IQMuV9JTOoiNGz2Pr70-Q4KKsaOXAnHqAkE8H6qs/edit#heading=h.lczo881h77nz">assignment or project (A2)</a>, <a href="http://tiny.cc/hccontribution">contribution to class</a> writeup, and <a href="http://tiny.cc/hcteamsupport">designing team support</a> were all initially due on or before April 14â€”however, Professor Williams has since confirmed that all these writeups can be submitted on or before April 28 (upper boundary). It is still highly recommended to update the relevant <a href="">tracker</a> dates for the deadlines so that the teaching team is aware of your deadlines and can start grading them right after April 14. 
        <br><br>
        <h3><li>Google Docs seems overwhelming and laggy. Is there a website version of the class requirements which is easier to load and view?</li></h3>
        Yes! The source code for the website can be accessed <a href="https://github.com/philippejlyu/CSC428-Website">here</a>. Also, please feel free to contribute to the repository if something is missing. 
        <br><br>  
        <h3><li>Where can I find grades for my previous assignments/ reflections?</li></h3>
        Grades for all assignments and reflections that were graded by the teaching team have been posted on Quercus. Please contact the teaching team if you cannot view your grades. 
        <br><br>  
        <h3><li>How do I get the two percent bonus points at the end of the class (as mentioned in the syllabus)?</li></h3>
        As was revealed on the penultimate week of the class by Professor Williams, one (1%) of the bonus points will be awarded to anyone who posts their final, before class reflections to Discord (under <a href="https://discord.com/channels/1061342191861112852/1091975860296368128">final-reflections</a>), and the other point (1%) will be awarded to any student who speaks up on the final Monday class and shares their final reflection with everyone. Make sure that you mention if you did any (or both) on the shared <a href="https://tiny.cc/hctracker">tracker</a> sheet.
